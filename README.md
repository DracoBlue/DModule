# Development Version Notice

If you see this message in your .zip/.tar.gz, you downloaded the development
version. That's why you need to head to <http://sa-mp.com> download the
windows binary package for the server and putt all *.exe files into the folder
*core/samp/*. Otherwise nor compiling, nor executing projects will work!

Of course there will be no real support if you are running on a development
version of dmodule, since the api and stuff is usually subject to change.
